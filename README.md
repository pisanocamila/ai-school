### Prepared by Nani for Susan Coelius Keplinger

## What Is This

This is your personal workspace for AI School — an 8-week hands-on program where you'll learn to use AI as a strategic tool while simultaneously improving Growth Signal's product.

**This is not a course. It's a co-building environment.**

Every session produces real output: better data, codified business rules, validated algorithms, and documented decisions that go directly into the product.

## Before Session 1 (Tuesday Feb 11)

**You don't need to do anything.** But if you want to get a head start:

1. **Skim** `program/AI_LEARNING_PROGRAM.md` — the 8-week roadmap (5 min read)
2. **Browse** `starter-kit/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` — try one prompt if you're curious
3. **Glance at** `vision/BRAIN_INTERFACE_IDEAS.md` — where this is all going
4. **Think about** a brief or task you'd normally write by hand — bring it Tuesday

## What You'll Be Able to Do After 8 Weeks

- Turn a verbal brief into a structured Notion document in 60 seconds
- Interrogate any UCR and find data quality issues instantly
- Codify business rules so the AI can apply them consistently
- QA any Growth Signal report before it goes to a client
- Query the entire FON knowledge base (12,500+ documents, 48 clients) by asking questions in plain English
- Design AI-assisted workflows for your team
