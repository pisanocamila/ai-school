# Growth Signal Intelligence Program

**8 weeks. 8 Tuesdays. You build a system that runs without you.**

## The problem

You know everything. That's the problem.

Quality standards, business rules, client patterns, what works, what doesn't, why something failed three quarters ago — it's all in your head. Your team can't access it unless you're in the room. New hires can't learn it unless they shadow you for months. Nothing scales because everything runs through you.

You're not slow. You're trapped. Trapped doing the operational work — reviewing, checking, correcting — instead of the work only you can do: thinking about what's next.

```
today:
    quality depends on       → you being in the room
    rules are applied when   → you remember to check
    patterns are visible to  → only you
    new hire gets up to speed → after months of shadowing you
    you go on vacation       → things break
```

The goal isn't to make you faster. The goal is to make the system smart enough that you don't need to be there.

## The solution

You take what you know and put it into a system the company owns. Not a document. Not a wiki nobody reads. A system that applies your rules automatically, answers questions across 48 clients in seconds, and enforces your quality standards whether you're in the room or not.

```
after 8 tuesdays:
    quality depends on       → the system, not any one person
    rules are applied        → automatically, every time
    patterns are visible to  → anyone who asks
    new hire gets up to speed → by querying the knowledge base on day 1
    you go on vacation       → nothing changes
```

You decide what goes in. You decide what gets automated. You approve everything before it becomes part of the system. Nothing moves without your OK.

> **Where does the data come from?** Your Notion workspaces. Your internal documents. Your operational data. Not personal chats. Not external sources. Everything the system knows, it knows because it's already in your systems — just structured, indexed, and made searchable.

None of this is anyone's fault. Every company works this way until someone builds the system that captures it. That's what we're doing here. Safely. Gradually. With you in control.

## What you'll build

```
for each rule you know:
    you define it once
    the system applies it across all clients
    your team follows it without asking
    new hires learn it without shadowing you

for each process you repeat:
    you map it: input → steps → output
    you automate it
    it runs on its own from that moment on

result:
    the operational work runs without you
    your time goes back to strategy, vision, and building what's next
```

## How every session works

Every Tuesday. 60 minutes. You build everything yourself.

```
every session:
    build     → you create something real, using your data
    test      → you run it against live data, see the results
    approve   → you review the output, you decide what stays
    advance   → approved work goes into the system

    if something feels wrong:
        we stop
        we fix it
        we test again
        you decide

    nothing ships without your OK
    the system only grows with what you trust
```

## 8 weeks — the recipe gets shorter

| Week | What you build | How much guidance |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Business rules + AI-generated brief in Notion | Full recipe |
| **2** | Cross-client insights across 48 clients | Full recipe |
| **3** | Quality standards codified + QA workflow | Less detail |
| **4** | Competitor pipeline rules v1 | Less detail |
| **5** | One complete AI workflow for your team | Ingredients only |
| **6** | Starter kit for your team to use AI | Ingredients only |
| **7** | AI-generated strategic brief for a real client | You decide |
| **8** | Complete AI playbook for Growth Signal | You decide |

Weeks 1–2: you get the full recipe and all the ingredients. Weeks 3–4: you get the ingredients and the key steps. Weeks 5–6: you get the goal and the tools. Weeks 7–8: you choose the goal, you pick the tools, you build it.

## After 8 Tuesdays

```
the system:
    applies your rules         → across all clients, every time
    enforces your standards    → without anyone reviewing manually
    answers questions          → across 48 clients, in seconds
    onboards new hires         → on day 1, not after months
    runs                       → whether we're in the room or not

you:
    stop operating             → start building
    stop reviewing             → start designing
    stop being the bottleneck  → start being the architect
```
