# Growth Signal Intelligence Program

**8 weeks. 8 Tuesdays. You build it. I guide you.**

Force of Nature × Growth Signal | February 2026

```
ChatGPT + manual work  →  you teach it your rules  →  the team starts using it  →  it runs on its own
```

You replace ChatGPT with an AI that actually knows your business. I don't build it for you — I guide you to build it yourself. We work as a team: I bring the technical knowledge, you bring the business knowledge. By week 8, you don't need me anymore.

> **Everything the system learns comes from your Notion workspaces and internal documents.** Not the internet. Not personal chats. Not generic training data. Your data. Your rules. Your business.

## The problem

You're trapped. Everything runs through you — quality standards, business rules, client patterns, what works, what doesn't. The team can't operate without you. New hires can't learn without shadowing you for months. Nothing scales because everything lives in your head.

And the AI you're using doesn't help. ChatGPT doesn't know your clients. It doesn't understand your rules. It can't access your 48 clients of data. You spend hours prompting, editing, and correcting AI that should already know what you know.

```
today:
    quality depends on         → you being in the room
    rules are applied when     → you remember to check
    patterns are visible to    → only you
    new hire gets up to speed  → after months of shadowing you
    you go on vacation         → things break
    you ask the AI a question  → it doesn't know your clients or rules
```

The goal isn't to make you faster. The goal is to build something better than ChatGPT — an AI that knows your clients, applies your rules, and works with your data. So the operational work runs without anyone needing to be in the room.

## The solution

You take what you know and teach it to a system the company owns. Not a document. Not a wiki nobody reads. An intelligence layer that applies your rules automatically, answers questions across 48 clients in seconds, and replaces ChatGPT with something that actually knows your business.

I don't do this for you. I teach you how to do it. Every rule you codify, you codify. Every workflow you build, you build. I'm the senior showing you the tools and the patterns — you're the one making the decisions and doing the work.

```
after 8 tuesdays:
    quality depends on         → the system, not any one person
    rules are applied          → automatically, every time
    patterns are visible to    → anyone who asks
    new hire gets up to speed  → by querying the system on day 1
    you go on vacation         → nothing changes
    you ask the AI a question  → it knows your clients, rules, and data
```

You decide what goes in. You decide what gets automated. You approve everything before it becomes part of the system. Nothing moves without your OK.

```
for each rule you know:
    you teach it once
    the system applies it across all clients
    the team uses it without asking
    new hires learn it without shadowing anyone

for each process you repeat:
    you map it: input → steps → output
    you automate it
    it runs on its own from that moment on

result:
    ChatGPT is replaced
    the operational work runs on its own
    your time goes back to strategy, vision, and building what's next
```

None of this is anyone's fault. Every company works this way until someone builds the system that captures their knowledge. That's what we're doing here. Safely. Gradually. With you in control.

## How we work together

```
roles:
    you    → the business expert, the decision maker, the builder
    me     → the technical guide, the senior, the one who shows you how

rule:
    I never build it for you
    I show you how, you do it
    every decision is yours
    by week 8, you do it without me
```

---

## The program — 8 Tuesdays

Every Tuesday. 60 minutes. You build it yourself. I guide you through it.

```
every session:
    build     → you teach the system something new, I show you how
    test      → you run it against live data, we review the results together
    approve   → you decide what stays, I don't decide for you
    advance   → approved knowledge goes into the system

    if something feels wrong:
        we stop
        we fix it together
        we test again
        you decide

    nothing goes in without your OK
```

The recipe gets shorter as you go:

| Week | What changes | Guidance |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **1** | The AI learns your first business rules | Full recipe |
| **2** | You search 48 clients for the first time — in seconds | Full recipe |
| **3** | Quality standards stop living in your head | Less detail |
| **4** | The competitor pipeline gets its first rules | Less detail |
| **5** | You build your first AI workflow from scratch | Ingredients only |
| **6** | The team starts using the system without you | Ingredients only |
| **7** | You generate a strategic brief with AI — for a real client | You decide |
| **8** | ChatGPT is replaced. The playbook is yours. | You decide |

## What your Tuesdays look like

```
week 1 tuesday:
    you arrive with a brief in mind
    you describe it out loud
    the AI structures it in Notion
    you codify your first business rules
    you leave with something real in the system
    time: 60 minutes

week 8 tuesday:
    you arrive with a question no one has asked before
    you query 48 clients in seconds
    you generate a strategic brief backed by real data
    you decide what to ship
    ChatGPT is not open on your screen
    time: 60 minutes
```

---

## After 8 Tuesdays

```
the system:
    applies your rules         → across all clients, every time
    enforces your standards    → without anyone reviewing manually
    answers questions          → across 48 clients, in seconds
    onboards new hires         → on day 1, not after months
    replaces ChatGPT           → with something that knows your business
    runs                       → whether we're in the room or not

you:
    stop using ChatGPT         → start using something better
    stop operating manually    → start designing solutions
    stop being the bottleneck  → start being the architect
```

After week 8, the system is yours. You won't need a recipe anymore — you'll be writing your own. I stay available for support, but the goal is that you don't need me. That's how you know it worked.
