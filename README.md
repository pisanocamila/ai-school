# Susan — here's what I prepared for Tuesday.

---

I loaded real Growth Signal data into the AI workspace so we can work with actual client information during our session — not hypotheticals.

I also put together an 8-week program. Not a course — every session produces real output that goes directly into the product. Codified rules, validated data, documented decisions.

This folder has everything for Session 1.

## What's here

**Start with these two:**
- `program/AI_LEARNING_PROGRAM.md` — the 8-week roadmap (5 min read)
- `starter-kit/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` — 14 prompts you can copy-paste right now into Claude or ChatGPT

**Data we'll use on Tuesday:**
- `data/oofos_ucr_summary.json` — OOFOS UCR, our first case study
- `data/oofos_ecg.md` — their Economic Center of Gravity, explained simply
- `data/ecg-validations/` — examples of AI-powered QA on real client reports (FitBod, Halo Collar)

**For later:**
- `competitor-audit/` — notes on the competitor pipeline we can discuss during the session
- `vision/BRAIN_INTERFACE_IDEAS.md` — 20 ideas for what becomes possible with AI + your data. Some are already built.

## Tuesday, Feb 11 — Session 1

Three things, 60 minutes:

1. **You describe a brief out loud. AI writes it. It appears in Notion.** (~10 min)
2. **We explore the OOFOS data together.** You ask questions, the AI finds answers — we see what it catches and what it misses. (~25 min)
3. **We start capturing your business rules.** The things your team knows intuitively but hasn't documented — we turn them into rules the AI can apply. (~15 min)

You don't need to prepare anything. But if you have a brief or task you'd normally write by hand — bring it. We'll use it live.

## The bigger picture

Every rule you capture, every quality standard you define, every workflow you design — it goes into the product. By week 8, you won't just understand AI. You'll have built the intelligence layer of Growth Signal.

The details are in `program/AI_LEARNING_PROGRAM.md`. The tools are in `starter-kit/`. The data is real. The session notes folder is empty — we'll fill it together.

*See you Tuesday.*
