# Growth Signal AI School

**Your councils deserve a better house than ChatGPT.**

Force of Nature × Growth Signal | February – April 2026

## What you already built

You built a governance system that works. A constitution. Councils with charters, seated members, non-negotiables, and optimization targets. Sub-domains that inherit from their parent. Cross-validation between councils. A pattern that scales from family sports to product strategy to company operations.

It works. It's insanely good. And it's trapped inside your personal ChatGPT.

```
today:
    your councils live in        → ChatGPT projects you can't share
    your charters are captured   → in threads only you can access
    alex needs your knowledge    → but can't see your councils
    a new module needs building  → you have to paste the charter every time
    context resets               → every time the thread gets too long
    the team operates            → only when you're in the room
```

The system isn't broken. The house is broken. Your councils need a permanent home — one the team can access, one that doesn't forget, one that scales without requiring your constant attention.

## What we're doing

We move your governance system out of ChatGPT and into infrastructure you own. Same councils. Same charters. Same rules. Better house.

```
your voice → structured charter → Notion page → team access → modules run on their own
```

You don't change how you think. You don't learn to code. You don't become a developer. You keep doing what you already do — building councils, defining charters, setting guardrails — and the system captures it, structures it, and makes it available to the team automatically.

> *"I don't want to become you. I want to be more efficient doing what I already do."* — Susan, Feb 9

That's exactly what this is.

## How it works

```
what stays the same:
    you define councils          → your expertise, your judgment
    you set non-negotiables      → your guardrails, your rules
    you approve everything       → nothing moves without your OK
    you talk to your phone       → voice-first, lightweight capture

what changes:
    charters live in             → Notion, not ChatGPT threads
    the team accesses them       → directly, without asking you
    modules get built from       → YouTube experts + your council rules
    alex doesn't need to         → learn martech (the system teaches him)
    context doesn't reset        → every council has a permanent page
    you share a council          → in one click, not by pasting walls of text
```

## The YouTube module approach

You had the insight: nothing we're building is new. Every module — market seasonality, competitor analysis, keyword mapping — has been explained by experts on YouTube. The tutorials exist. The transcripts exist.

The gap was always: *someone still has to go do it*. At scale, that's expensive. With AI, it's not.

```
for each module:
    1. your council defines       → what the module should do and its constraints
    2. the system finds           → the 3 best YouTube videos by domain experts
    3. transcripts become         → module instructions (automatically)
    4. alex runs it               → without needing 10 years of martech experience
    5. the council validates      → output meets your standards

result:
    alex doesn't need to learn martech
    the system captures the best experts' knowledge
    your council ensures quality
    modules scale without you being in the room
```

## How we work together

```
roles:
    you    → the architect, the governor, the one who sets the rules
    me     → the technical guide, the one who builds the house
    alex   → the operator, the one who runs the modules

rule:
    you never do technical work
    I never make business decisions
    alex never operates without council guardrails
    the system makes everyone faster, not busier
```

> ⚠️ **Watch intensity creep.** This program makes you more efficient and more effective. It does not make you do more work. If it ever feels like more work, we stop and fix it.

Everything stays in your Notion workspace. No external training. No data leaving your systems.

## The program — 8 Tuesdays

Every Tuesday. 60 minutes. You talk, the system captures.

| Week | What happens | You do |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Your first council moves to Notion. You see it structured and permanent. | Talk through a charter. Watch it appear in Notion. |
| 2 | Alex validates competitor data using your council rules. | Review what the system found. Approve or adjust. |
| 3 | Module instructions get built from YouTube expert transcripts. | Pick a module. Point to the best videos. Review output. |
| 4 | Your non-negotiables become automated guardrails. | Define the rules. The system enforces them. |
| 5 | The team runs a full analysis without asking you. | Review the result. You didn't have to be in the room. |
| 6 | Multiple councils are live. Cross-validation works. | Spot-check. Adjust. The system is learning your patterns. |
| 7 | A real client gets a Growth Signal report — built by the system. | Review. Approve. Ship. |
| 8 | The playbook is complete. In person. Poland. | You own it. You don't need me anymore. |

```
every session:
    you talk         → the system structures
    you review       → the system adjusts
    you approve      → it becomes permanent
    you leave        → with something real that the team can use tomorrow

    if something feels wrong:
        we stop
        we fix it
        nothing ships without your OK
```

## What your Tuesdays look like

```
week 1 tuesday:
    you arrive with a council charter in mind
    you describe it — voice, paste, or screen share
    the system structures it in Notion
    you review: "is this right?"
    you approve it
    alex can now access it and build from it
    time: 60 minutes

week 8 tuesday:
    you arrive in poland
    the system has your constitution, your councils, your modules
    the team has been operating without you for weeks
    you review everything we built
    ChatGPT is not open on your screen
    the governance system is yours — permanently
    time: 60 minutes
```

## After 8 Tuesdays

```
your councils:
    live permanently in          → Notion, not ChatGPT threads
    are accessible to            → the team, not just you
    enforce guardrails           → automatically, every time
    scale to new domains         → without you pasting charters

your modules:
    are built from               → expert knowledge (YouTube + your rules)
    are validated by             → your council constraints
    run across clients           → without anyone needing martech expertise
    produce output that          → meets your standards, every time

your time:
    goes back to                 → building new councils, new ideas, new domains
    doesn't go to                → repeating yourself, pasting context, reviewing basics
    is protected by              → the system doing the operational work

the team:
    operates with                → your judgment encoded in the system
    doesn't need to              → shadow you for months to learn your rules
    can build modules            → by following council-defined instructions
```

## The constitution stays yours

Everything in this system traces back to your constitution:

> *"Make sure my intelligence, judgment, values, creativity, humanity compound over time without requiring my constant attention."*

Every council we move, every module we build, every guardrail we automate — it serves that mission. If it doesn't, we don't build it.

The system is the house. The constitution is the foundation. The councils are the rooms. We're just giving them a better address.
