# AI School — Growth Signal Intelligence Program

**An 8-week hands-on program to turn institutional knowledge into a queryable intelligence layer.**

Force of Nature × Growth Signal | February 2026

## The Problem

Growth Signal has years of strategic knowledge spread across Notion workspaces, client reports, internal documents, and operational data. Business rules are applied intuitively. Quality standards live in people's heads. Cross-client patterns are invisible unless someone manually connects the dots.

When the person who knows the rules isn't in the room, the rules don't get applied.

## The Solution

An AI-powered intelligence layer built entirely on Growth Signal's existing Notion workspaces, internal documentation, and operational data — where business rules are codified, quality standards are enforced automatically, and institutional knowledge becomes searchable, teachable, and scalable.

> **All data comes from Force of Nature's Notion workspaces and Growth Signal's internal systems.** Client reports, strategy documents, QA frameworks, operational playbooks, and product data — structured, indexed, and made queryable.

## What You'll Build

By the end of 8 weeks:

- **Your business rules run automatically.** The competitor algorithm, the ECG validation, the QA standards — codified once, enforced every time.
- **You can query 48 clients in seconds.** "What worked for footwear brands?" "Which clients have the same ECG pattern?" Answers with sources, not decks.
- **Your team operates at your standard — without you in the room.** Quality standards, decision frameworks, and review criteria built into the system.
- **You design AI workflows independently.** Not dependent on anyone. You see a process, you build the workflow, it runs.

## Program — Week by Week

Every Tuesday. 60 minutes. You build everything yourself.

The method is simple: early sessions give you the ingredients and the full recipe. As you progress, the recipe gets shorter. By the end, you're writing your own.

---

### Week 1 — First Contact
`Full recipe.` You get step-by-step instructions. You describe a brief out loud — the AI structures it and puts it in Notion. You open the OOFOS UCR and interrogate it live. You codify your first business rules.
> **You build:** Your first AI-generated brief + your first business rules in Notion.

### Week 2 — Pattern Recognition
`Full recipe.` You query the FON Knowledge Base for the first time — 12,561 documents across 48 clients. You find patterns across clients. You compare strategies across industries.
> **You build:** Cross-client insights that were invisible until now.

### Week 3 — Quality Control
`Recipe with less detail.` You know the tools now. You QA a full UCR end-to-end. You flag data issues. You define the quality standards — the AI enforces them from that moment on.
> **You build:** Your quality standards codified + a working QA workflow.

### Week 4 — Competitor Intelligence
`Recipe with less detail.` You audit the competitor algorithm. You define the rules your team applies intuitively — marketplace exclusions, ECG validation, candidate qualification. You codify them.
> **You build:** Competitor pipeline rules v1 — documented, testable, enforceable.

### Week 5 — Workflow Design
`Ingredients only.` You get the goal and the tools. You pick a recurring process and design the AI workflow yourself. Inputs, process, outputs — you map it, you build it.
> **You build:** One complete AI workflow ready for your team.

### Week 6 — Team Enablement
`Ingredients only.` You prepare prompts and workflows for 1–2 team members. You test them on real tasks. Your team starts operating with AI.
> **You build:** A starter kit for your team to use AI independently.

### Week 7 — Strategic Analysis
`No recipe.` You decide what to analyze. You synthesize data across multiple clients. You generate strategic recommendations backed by the knowledge base.
> **You build:** An AI-generated strategic brief for a real client.

### Week 8 — Integration
`No recipe.` You review everything you've built. You identify what to scale. You plan the next quarter. The intelligence layer is yours.
> **You build:** A complete AI playbook for Growth Signal — and the ability to design new workflows on your own.
