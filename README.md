# Susan — here's what I built for Tuesday.

---

I audited the competitor pipeline. I found that OOFOS has zero competitors in the system — the algorithm never ran for them. I also found that Ember's list includes Amazon and Best Buy, which shouldn't be there based on the rules you described on Feb 6.

I built a knowledge base from 48 FON clients — 12,561 documents, searchable by client, channel, and industry. You can ask it "what are the quick wins for Marine Layer?" and get an answer with sources in 5 seconds.

I put together an 8-week program. Not a course — a co-building environment where every session produces real output that goes directly into Growth Signal.

This folder is everything you need for Session 1.

## What's here

**Start with these two:**
- `program/AI_LEARNING_PROGRAM.md` — the 8-week roadmap (5 min read)
- `starter-kit/PROMPT_LIBRARY.md` — 14 prompts you can copy-paste right now into Claude or ChatGPT

**The work I've already done:**
- `competitor-audit/` — what I found auditing the pipeline across all 37 client configs
- `data/oofos_ucr_summary.json` — the OOFOS UCR we'll interrogate together on Tuesday
- `data/oofos_ecg.md` — their Economic Center of Gravity, explained simply
- `data/ecg-validations/` — FitBod and Halo Collar QA reports (one of them says "NOT CMO-SAFE" — you'll see why)

**Where this is going:**
- `vision/BRAIN_INTERFACE_IDEAS.md` — 20 ideas for what becomes possible when you treat your 6,354 ChatGPT conversations as a queryable intelligence system. Some of them are already built.

## Tuesday, Feb 11 — Session 1

We're going to do three things:

1. **You describe a brief out loud. AI writes it. It appears in Notion.** (~10 min)
2. **We interrogate the OOFOS data together.** I'll show you how to ask questions the data can't hide from. (~25 min)
3. **You tell me the rules your team applies when reviewing competitors. We codify them.** From now on, the AI enforces them. (~15 min)

You don't need to prepare anything. But if you want to bring a brief or task you'd normally write by hand — that would make Act 1 even better.

## The bigger picture

You said you wanted to learn AI by doing real work, not by watching demos.

That's exactly what this is. Every rule you codify, every quality standard you define, every workflow you design — it goes into the product. By week 8, you won't just understand AI. You'll have built the intelligence layer of Growth Signal.

The details are in `program/AI_LEARNING_PROGRAM.md`. The tools are in `starter-kit/`. The data is real. The session notes folder is empty — we'll fill it together.

*See you Tuesday.*
