# AI School — Growth Signal Intelligence Program

**An 8-week hands-on program to turn institutional knowledge into a queryable intelligence layer.**

Force of Nature × Growth Signal | February 2026

## The Problem

Right now, Growth Signal's quality depends on Susan being in the room. Business rules live in her head. Quality standards are applied when she reviews. Cross-client patterns exist only when she connects the dots manually.

That means Susan spends her time **operating** — reviewing, correcting, checking — instead of doing what only she can do: thinking about the future, designing new products, building the next thing.

The goal isn't to make Susan faster. The goal is to **free Susan entirely** — so that nothing falls apart when she's not looking, and she can focus on what matters most.

## The Solution

An intelligence layer that belongs to the company — not to any one person. Built entirely on Growth Signal's existing Notion workspaces, internal documentation, and operational data.

The business rules live in the system. The quality standards live in the system. The knowledge lives in the system. It doesn't depend on Susan. It doesn't depend on Nani. It doesn't depend on anyone.

> **All data comes from Force of Nature's Notion workspaces and Growth Signal's internal systems.** Client reports, strategy documents, QA frameworks, operational playbooks, and product data — structured, indexed, and made queryable.

The goal is a system that runs whether we're in the room or not.

## What You'll Build

You teach the system your rules. You define the standards. You decide what gets automated and what stays manual. Everything the system does, it does because you designed it that way.

By the end of 8 weeks:

- **Your business rules are codified — by you.** The competitor algorithm, the ECG validation, the QA standards. You define them once. The system applies them consistently, the way you would.
- **Your quality standards are in the system — because you put them there.** Your team can follow them without guessing. New hires can learn them without shadowing you for months.
- **You can query 48 clients in seconds.** "What worked for footwear brands?" "Which clients have the same ECG pattern?" Answers with sources, whenever you need them.
- **You design new AI workflows on your own.** You see a repetitive process, you build the automation, you decide when to deploy it.

**What changes:** The repetitive work — the reviewing, the checking, the "did anyone follow the rules?" — that runs on its own. The system doesn't need us. Our time goes back to building what's next.

## Program — Week by Week

Every Tuesday. 60 minutes. You build everything yourself.

The method is simple: early sessions give you the ingredients and the full recipe. As you progress, the recipe gets shorter. By the end, you're writing your own.

---

### Week 1 — First Contact
`Full recipe.` You get step-by-step instructions. You describe a brief out loud — the AI structures it and puts it in Notion. You open the OOFOS UCR and interrogate it live. You codify your first business rules.
> **You build:** Your first AI-generated brief + your first business rules in Notion.

### Week 2 — Pattern Recognition
`Full recipe.` You query the FON Knowledge Base for the first time — 12,561 documents across 48 clients. You find patterns across clients. You compare strategies across industries.
> **You build:** Cross-client insights that were invisible until now.

### Week 3 — Quality Control
`Recipe with less detail.` You know the tools now. You QA a full UCR end-to-end. You flag data issues. You define the quality standards — the AI enforces them from that moment on.
> **You build:** Your quality standards codified + a working QA workflow.

### Week 4 — Competitor Intelligence
`Recipe with less detail.` You audit the competitor algorithm. You define the rules your team applies intuitively — marketplace exclusions, ECG validation, candidate qualification. You codify them.
> **You build:** Competitor pipeline rules v1 — documented, testable, enforceable.

### Week 5 — Workflow Design
`Ingredients only.` You get the goal and the tools. You pick a recurring process and design the AI workflow yourself. Inputs, process, outputs — you map it, you build it.
> **You build:** One complete AI workflow ready for your team.

### Week 6 — Team Enablement
`Ingredients only.` You prepare prompts and workflows for 1–2 team members. You test them on real tasks. Your team starts operating with AI.
> **You build:** A starter kit for your team to use AI independently.

### Week 7 — Strategic Analysis
`No recipe.` You decide what to analyze. You synthesize data across multiple clients. You generate strategic recommendations backed by the knowledge base.
> **You build:** An AI-generated strategic brief for a real client.

### Week 8 — Integration
`No recipe.` You review everything you've built. You identify what to scale. You plan the next quarter. The intelligence layer is yours.
> **You build:** A complete AI playbook for Growth Signal — and the ability to design new workflows on your own.
